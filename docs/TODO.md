   # Prioritize: test_isin_api.py, test_auth_dependencies.py, test_cash_account_integration.py
   pytest tests/ -v --tb=short -x  # Run tests with stop on first failure
   ```

2. **Real Market Data Integration** üíπ

   ```bash
   # Replace mock service with real providers
   # Update backend/services/market_data.py
   # Add your API keys to .env (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)
