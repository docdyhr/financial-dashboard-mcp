## ðŸŽ¯ Prioritized Action Plan

### ðŸ”¥ High Priority (Critical for Production)

#### 1. Test Suite Resolution

- [ ] **Fix ISIN API tests** - 24 failures in `test_isin_api.py` (validation, resolver, lookup).

- [ ] **Fix authentication dependency tests** - 8 failures in `test_auth_dependencies.py`.

- [ ] **Fix cash account integration** - 6 failures in `test_cash_account_integration.py`.

- [ ] **Fix ISIN sync service tests** - 5 failures in `test_isin_sync_service.py`.

- [ ] **Performance test fixes** - 4 failures in `test_isin_performance.py`.

- **Command**: `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short -x`

#### 2. Real Market Data Integration

- [ ] Replace mock data service with real providers.

- [ ] Implement multi-provider fallback for reliability.

- [ ] Enhance ISIN service for European market coverage.

- [ ] Backfill historical prices for analysis.

- [ ] Optimize rate limiting with caching.

#### 3. Production Deployment

- [ ] Deploy to production environment with secure credentials.

- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates and HTTPS.

- [ ] Set up monitoring (logging, metrics, alerting).

- [ ] Conduct performance testing with realistic data volumes.

- [ ] Implement automated backups and recovery.

- [ ] Finalize operational runbooks and deployment guides.

---

### âš¡ Medium Priority (Performance and Scalability)

#### 4. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile backend to optimize slow database queries and API endpoints.

- [ ] Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data.

- [ ] Add database query optimization and indexing.

- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets.

#### 5. Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Add structured logging for better debugging.

- [ ] Implement metrics collection and distributed tracing.

- [ ] Set up Prometheus or New Relic for backend monitoring.

- [ ] Track user interactions and performance metrics in the Streamlit app.

#### 6. Dependency Management

- [ ] Regularly update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.

- [ ] Use tools like `bandit` or `safety` to scan for vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Ensure consistent virtual environment setup across the team.

---

### ðŸ§ª Low Priority (Enhancements and Maintenance)

#### 7. Test Coverage Enhancement

- [ ] Add frontend component tests (currently 0% coverage).

- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage target (currently ~82% pass rate).

- [ ] Add end-to-end integration tests.

#### 8. Frontend Improvements

- [ ] Review Streamlit app for usability and design improvements.

- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback for better UX.

- [ ] Optimize data fetching and caching in the frontend.

#### 9. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Use a `.env` file for managing sensitive environment variables.

- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization.

- [ ] Implement rate limiting and security headers.

#### 10. Documentation

- [ ] Update `README.md` with setup instructions and test execution steps.

- [ ] Expand `TESTING.md` with details about the test suite and markers.

- [ ] Add API documentation with examples.

- [ ] Create deployment and troubleshooting guides.
