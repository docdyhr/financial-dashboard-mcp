# Security Guidelines and Audit Checklist

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices and provides a comprehensive audit checklist for the Financial Dashboard application.

## ⚠️ Critical Security Notice

**NEVER commit the following to version control:**
- `.env` files with real credentials
- API keys or tokens
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets
- Personal email addresses
- Any production credentials

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅

- [ ] All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No default passwords in production configuration
- [ ] All secrets are strong and randomly generated
- [ ] Environment variables are properly validated
- [ ] Production uses `ENVIRONMENT=production` and `DEBUG=False`

### 2. Secrets Management 🔐

- [ ] **SECRET_KEY**: Generated using `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"`
- [ ] **Database Password**: At least 32 characters, randomly generated
- [ ] **API Keys**: Registered with your own accounts, not shared
- [ ] **MCP_AUTH_TOKEN**: Generated using secure random methods
- [ ] **JWT Configuration**: Strong secret key, appropriate expiration times

### 3. Database Security 💾

- [ ] Database uses strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS in production
- [ ] Database access is restricted by IP/firewall rules
- [ ] Regular database backups are configured
- [ ] Database user has minimal required privileges

### 4. Authentication & Authorization 🔑

- [ ] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (never plain text or weak hashing)
- [ ] JWT tokens have appropriate expiration times
- [ ] Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- [ ] Session management is properly implemented
- [ ] Two-factor authentication is available (recommended)

### 5. API Security 🌐

- [ ] CORS is properly configured for production domains only
- [ ] API endpoints use proper authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection headers are set

### 6. Network Security 🛡️

- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificates are configured
- [ ] Security headers are implemented (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict unnecessary ports
- [ ] Internal services are not exposed to the internet
- [ ] Load balancer/reverse proxy is configured

### 7. Docker Security 🐳

- [ ] Base images are from trusted sources
- [ ] Images are regularly updated for security patches
- [ ] Containers run as non-root users
- [ ] Secrets are managed using Docker secrets, not environment variables
- [ ] Container-to-container communication is restricted

### 8. Monitoring & Logging 📊

- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Log files are protected and rotated
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are configured for suspicious activity
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Centralized logging is configured

### 9. Third-Party Services 🔗

- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly
- [ ] Service accounts have minimal permissions
- [ ] Webhook endpoints are authenticated
- [ ] External service dependencies are documented
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for service failures

### 10. Code Security 💻

- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date (no known vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code reviews include security considerations
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces in production)

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

1. **Generate Production Credentials**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_production.sh
   ```

2. **Review Generated Configuration**
   - Check `.env` file for completeness
   - Update CORS_ORIGINS with your domain
   - Ensure all placeholders are replaced

3. **Set Up SSL/TLS**
   - Obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
   - Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik)
   - Enable HTTPS redirect

4. **Configure Firewall**
   ```bash
   # Example UFW configuration
   ufw allow 22/tcp      # SSH
   ufw allow 80/tcp      # HTTP (for redirect)
   ufw allow 443/tcp     # HTTPS
   ufw enable
   ```

5. **Deploy with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

6. **Post-Deployment**
   - Verify all services are running
   - Test authentication flow
   - Check monitoring dashboards
   - Perform security scan

## 🔍 Security Audit Commands

### Check for Exposed Secrets
```bash
# Search for potential secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|token\|key" --include="*.py" --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" .

# Check git history for secrets
git log -p | grep -i -E "(password|secret|token|key|api)"
```

### Dependency Security Check
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Update dependencies
pip list --outdated
```

### Docker Security Scan
```bash
# Scan Docker images
docker scout cves <image-name>
```

## 🚨 Incident Response

1. **If Credentials Are Exposed:**
   - Immediately rotate all affected credentials
   - Review access logs for unauthorized usage
   - Update all systems using the credentials
   - Notify affected users if applicable

2. **Security Breach Protocol:**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve logs for investigation
   - Reset all credentials
   - Perform security audit
   - Document lessons learned

## 🤝 Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@yourdomain.com
- Do not disclose publicly until patched

**Remember**: Security is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regular audits and updates are essential for maintaining a secure application.
